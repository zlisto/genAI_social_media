    "description": "Hopps & Wilde are BACK 🦊🐰\nGet ready for #Zootopia2, only in theaters November 26!\n\nAfter cracking the biggest case in Zootopia’s history, rookie cops Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voice of Jason Bateman) find their partnership isn’t as solid as they thought when Chief Bogo (voice of Idris Elba) orders them to join the Partners in Crisis counseling program. But it doesn’t take long for their partnership to be put to the ultimate test when they find themselves on the twisting trail of a mystery tied to the arrival of a venomous snake in the animal metropolis. The trailer, poster and trailer stills are now available to download and share.\n \nWhile “Zootopia 2” introduces Gary De’Snake (voice of Ke Huy Quan), Nibbles (voice of Fortune Feimster) and quokka therapist Dr. Fuzzby (voice of Quinta Brunson), the upcoming feature film also welcomes back a herd of characters who made their debut in the Oscar®-winning film “Zootopia.” “It’s been an absolute joy to reteam with so many actors who made the first film so special, and so exciting to expand the world with our phenomenal new cast members,” said director/writer Jared Bush (chief creative officer for Walt Disney Animation Studios). “I can’t wait for audiences to see what other surprises we have in store in this brand-new adventure.”\n\nSee more from official Disney Animation:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation\nX: https://twitter.com/disneyanimation\n\nWelcome to the official Walt Disney Animation Studios YouTube channel!

So, espe\nkind of seems like a huge\nmisunderstanding.\nNotice how she answered first, did not\nallow her partner to speak, and taps her\nfoot when she's suppressing discomfort.\nAnd observe the source of her discomfort\nrepresented by the disconnected\naffectation of her emotionally insecure\npartner. Oh,\n>> but for now we begin by greeting our\nteammate.\n>> Okay. Unfortunately, Karen has chosen to\nsee Joel's smile as a sign of\naggression. Hackles down. Karen. Karen.\nHackles down. Someone get the hose.\n>> Bunny Fox. This is a make or break\nassignment. Fail and I will split you\nup.\n>> No snake has set foot in Zootopia in\nforever.\n>> Hops and wild.\n>> Wild and hops. The dream team.\nSorry, Paul.\n>> 1 2 3 4\nright now.\n>> Stop in the name of the law. I'm really\nsorry.\n>> Stop pulling my ears. Stop pulling my\nears. Don't ever pull a bunny's ears. I\nhave to help my family. Cannonball.\n[Music]\n>> You know this is not your worst idea.\n>> Wow, that was almost a compliment.\n>> Your worst idea is what you did with\nyour ears.\nHey ho.",
