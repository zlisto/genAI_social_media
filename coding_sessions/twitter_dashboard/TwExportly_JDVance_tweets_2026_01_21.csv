First of all, she's not waving the officers through and has no right to do so even if she were. She is waving another car through, before the officers approach her car. 

Second, the officers are not randomly searching her, they are approaching her vehicle because she is violating the law: namely, she is obstructing a lawful enforcement operation. You're not allowed to walk up to or drive up to people who are enforcing the law to make it harder for them to do their jobs. 

Third, this defense attorney is drawing a meaningless distinction between an ICE officer and a ""real police officer."" Again, you're not allowed to interrupt a lawful enforcement operation, which is exactly what this woman was doing.
