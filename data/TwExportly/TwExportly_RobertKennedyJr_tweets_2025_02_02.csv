The 60-year strategy of lies and secrecy, disinformation, censorship, and defamation employed by Intel officials to obscure and suppress troubling facts about JFK’s assassination has provided the playbook for a series of subsequent crises — the MLK and RFK assassinations, Vietnam, 9/11, the Iraq war and COVID — that have each accelerated the subversion of our exemplary democracy by the Military/Medical Industrial Complex and pushed us further down the road toward totalitarianism.

“A nation that does not trust its people is a nation that is afraid of its people.” A government that withholds information is inherently fearful of its citizens’ ability to make informed decisions and participate actively in democracy.

Sanders: “I’m still not hearing you. What is the reason that our kids are unhealthy? … Are you prepared to tell us that this committee, this Congress needs to take on the food and beverage industry, whose greed is destroying the health of millions of people?”

Sanders: “You’re not?”

Califf: “No.”

Sanders: “That is your job!”

Califf: “No … it’s to point out how to make progress in this area.”

“So, there needs to be a plan and it needs to be implemented in a mature, thoughtful way across the country.”

Sanders: “How many years does it take to do it? 14 years enough time? How many kids have died and gotten sick during those 14 years?”

Most importantly an NIH case-control study found an age-specific increase in osteosarcoma risk in boys exposed during the 6th to 8th year of life (Bassin 2005).,en,Reply,49,494,65,39,21604,2024-11-20 22:09:32,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

“If we were crushing it [at health], we would not be spending 2x every other country in the entire world and have the lowest life expectancy of any developed country in the entire world.”

“We are the sickest of the top 11 high-income countries in the world. We have the highest infant and maternal mortality rates, and our life expectancy is 10 years less than our friends in Japan and Switzerland right now.”

“The words 'chronic illness,' as far as I know, never came out of the Harris campaign's mouth. And I think that was a real misstep because Americans are, I think, tired of being gaslit about the fact that there's not a problem right now. And when we look around us, we know there is.”

“And Trump has asked RFK to do three simple things. He's asked to get the corruption out of the U.S. health agencies, produce uncompromised evidence-based research for our health guidelines, and reverse the trends of the chronic disease epidemic in two years for children and adults so that we can show up for our 250th anniversary of America stronger than ever. That sounds pretty good to me.”

'1853789874035532189',"RT @michaelpconnett: NPR's ""news"" piece on RFK's #fluoride tweet fails to tell readers and listeners that an Obama-appointed federal judge found, after hearing extensive testimony from government scientists and NIH-funded experts, that fluoridating water ""poses an unreasonable risk"" to human health.  

NPR also fails to tell readers that (1) there's no need to ingest fluoride for cavity prevention (from water or any other source) since fluoride's predominant benefit to teeth is topical, not systemic -- as even the CDC now admits; (2) a recent gold-standard systematic review from the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that fluoridation has much less benefit than commonly believed (and may have no benefit at all); and (3) the vast majority of Europe has rejected water fluoridation with no discernible detriment to their teeth.  

But the author @gbrumfiel was able to find plenty of space to smear those raising concerns about fluoride - which he admits he enjoyed doing. #Journalism

'1852447487610564725',"Tony Hinchcliffe is my friend. His special comedic aptitude for shattering orthodoxies and offending sensitivities has made him the king of roast comedy. I was therefore dismayed but not shocked at his offensive joke about Puerto Rico at President Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally last weekend. I was also not surprised that the DNC’s allied corporate media did not report the groans of the crowd in response to Tony’s gag but instead leapt to weaponize the joke to validate their mischaracterization of the rally as a rightwing Nazi hate fest. The joke was a gift to DNC strategists striving to blunt President Trump’s exploding support among Latinos. I knew the joke would also hurt the feelings of my many Puerto Rican friends who are accustomed to watching politicians, military brass, and corporate leaders use the island as a dumping ground for substandard business practices while blaming Puerto Ricans for their poverty, poor health, and environmental degradation on the island. The worst of these villains are the pharmaceutical and processed food firms that have buried the island in excess packaging material and toxic waste.

My strong ties to Puerto Rico go back to 1964 when I first visited the island with Sargent Shriver, who was director of LBJ’s War on Poverty. My family already had strong and affectionate relations with Puerto Rican leaders going back to Governor Luis Muñoz Marín, the George Washington of the Commonwealth. I spent the summer of 2001 in a maximum-security prison in Puerto Rico for my role as a leader in the fight to stop the Naval bombardment of Vieques. The Navy’s illegal dumping of millions of tons of highly toxic Naval ordnance had poisoned the fish and birds, destroyed the beaches and forests, and left the island’s people with the highest cancer rates and the highest unemployment in the Caribbean. I named my youngest son Aidan Vieques because the first time I saw him was in the prison’s visitor room. We succeeded in driving the Navy out of Vieques, but the Pentagon left behind millions of tons of unexploded ordnance and toxic waste despite repeated promises and multiple court orders that they remove it. This is some of the “garbage” that Tony was referring to in his unfortunate joke.

Although they recognized his joke was, well — a joke — many Puerto Ricans familiar with these practices still felt wounded by Tony’s words — which seemed to blame Puerto Ricans for the waste that U.S. military, political, and corporate leaders have dumped on their island. But most of the Puerto Ricans with whom I have spoken also recognize that the gag does not represent President Trump’s sympathies toward the island and its people.

Former Governor Ricky Rosello recounted to me that no U.S. president has done more for Puerto Rico in recent decades than President Trump, who came personally to the island after Hurricane Maria hit in 2017 and did everything in his power to make sure that the distressed citizens of the hard-hit island would not feel abandoned by their government. After he and Melania toured the hurricane damage and met with victims, President Trump said that he and the First Lady loved and were praying for the “great, great people” on the “great and beautiful island” of Puerto Rico. “We’re marshaling every federal resource at our disposal,” he said. “We now have more than 15,000 federal personnel on the island. We will not rest until that job is done. Puerto Rico has a long road of recovery ahead, but we know that its people are proud and they are resilient and they will come back strong.”

On Tuesday at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, he said, “Nobody loves our Latino community and our Puerto Rican community more than I do.” He promised, “I will deliver the best future for Puerto Ricans and Hispanic Americans.”

At the same rally, Zoraida Buxó, Puerto Rico’s shadow Senator, gave President Trump her enthusiastic endorsement. “I strongly and fully support and endorse Donald J. Trump to be our 47th president — to make America great again and, of course, to make Puerto Rico shine again,” Buxó told the crowd. “We need this man back in the White House. We need this man to be our commander-in-chief. He will make us feel safe, and he will protect us.”

As a New York businessman, President Trump watched and appreciated the economic contributions of Puerto Ricans in New York. The tiny island has also given our city a disproportionate share of our greatest politicians, actors, entertainers, and sports heroes.

Given his history of support for Puerto Rico and its people, I am confident that when he is in the White House, President Trump will look out for the best interests of Puerto Ricans and Hispanic Americans, who now make up a big and growing part of the expansive MAGA coalition poised to give him victory on November 5.",en,Tweet,2145,55856,9045,3361,2801199,2024-11-01 16:27:52,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

I also know that we are only 15 years into the iphone revolution and a mere 25 years into the cell-phones-are-everywhere-thing… and my trust that it’s all safe (putting aside how much they suck and kill our kids without regard to radiation through porn and screen addiction) has to depend on more government bureaucrats and more frigging conflicted “experts.”  Maybe it’s quackery to suggest otherwise, I don’t f’ing know… I am just told to trust the studies.

Today that number has dropped to 31%. Scruples along with personal and professional ethics are now professional liabilities in the MSM which has become a cesspool for scoundrels, liars, gossipmongers and tawdry grifters. Wapo and NyTimes are dying institutions leveraging the final dregs of their former reputations to serve advertisers and partisan agendas dictated by Intelligence agencies. They have made themselves bullhorns for official propaganda and collaborators in censorship. The only investigative journalism worth reading -people like Walter Kirn , Matt Taibbi, Paul Thacker, Glenn Greenwald and others- survives solely in the swelling netherworld of independent media. That bustling universe provides hope for journalism ‘s future.

He did that to protect his wealth and his system, which he calls philanthrocapitalism, which is a way of making yourself rich by pretending to give money away to good causes. And he wants to keep that. He just got indicted in the Netherlands and is going to trial. 

You know, I published an Instagram post or an expose that said, you're welcome, Kamala.

It turns out that the Biden-Harris regime expanded domestic military authority to include LETHAL force.

What this means is the Department of Defense now has the power to step in and use lethal force within U.S. borders, even against its own citizens, when it deems lives are at risk.

The scope of this authority is chilling because the directive specifically states that the decision to use lethal force only needs the Secretary of Defense’s approval. Once lethal force is approved, anything can happen.

'1848499491151745180',"Fast Food is a part of American culture. But that doesn’t mean it has to be unhealthy, and that we can’t make better choices. Did you know that McDonald’s used to use beef tallow to make their fries from 1940 until phasing it out in favor of seed oils in 1990? This switch was made because saturated animal fats were thought to be unhealthy, but we have since discovered that seed oils are one of the driving causes of the obesity epidemic. Interestingly enough, this began to drastically rise around the same time fast food restaurants switched from beef tallow to seed oils in their fryers.

'1844500399950123206',"My mom, Ethel Skakel Kennedy, passed peacefully into Heaven this morning. She was 96. She died in Boston surrounded by many of her nine surviving children and her friends. God gave her 34 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren, and the energy to give them all the attention they required. He blessed her with a rich and eventful life. Even as she declined in recent months, she never lost her sense of fun, her humor, her spark, her spunk, and her joie de vivre. She wrung joy from every moment, but for 56 years she has spoken with yearning of the day she would reunite with her beloved husband. She is with him now, with my brothers David and Michael, with her parents, her six siblings, all of whom predeceased her, and her “adopted” Kennedy siblings Jack, Kick, Joe, Teddy, Eunice, Jean, Rosemary, and Patricia. From the day she met my father, her new family observed that she was “more Kennedy than the Kennedys.” She was never more enthusiastic about the afterlife than when she considered that she would also be reunited with her many dogs, including 16 Irish setters — all conveniently named “Rusty.”

The cognitive dissonance that allowed her to keep two inconsistent truths in her heart at the same time without budging made my mother a collection of irreconcilable convictions. Among these was her ironic combination of deep — nearly blind — reverence for the Catholic Church and irreverence toward its clerics. She was at once starstruck by America’s presidents, all of whom she came to know personally, and at the same time skeptical of government and toward all figures of authority. She balanced her contempt for pretension and hypocrisy with a boundless tolerance for error and mistakes in others.

God also endowed her with a perpetual attitude of gratitude that fueled her taste for adventure and an irrepressible buoyancy in a life beset by a continuous parade of heartbreaking tragedies. Her sunny optimism eventually brought my shattered father back to life following the assassination of his brother and then helped her children to thrive after her husband’s assassination five years later.

Among her most defining qualities were moral and physical fearlessness. She was a peerless equestrian and held the high jump record on horseback, jumping 7′9″ on a Quarter Horse. Critics named her among the best female amateur tennis players, and she was a competitive diver. But she did every sport well — from football to skiing, waterskiing and kayaking. Her disciplined stoicism and her deep faith in God enabled her to endure over ten years of pregnancy without complaint. She also suffered the murders of her husband and Uncle Jack, and the early deaths of two of her children. Various air crashes killed both of her parents, her brother, her sister-in-law, and her nephew John. She never enjoyed flying, but her worry never stopped her from boarding a plane. While giving short shrift to her own monumental suffering, she always showed intense compassion for others.

My mother invented tough love, and she could be hard on her children when we didn’t live up to her expectations. But she was also intensely loyal, and we always knew that she would stand fiercely behind us when we came under attack by others. She was our role model for self-discipline, for resilience, and for self-confidence. She deeded to each of her 11 children her love of good stories, her athleticism, her competitive spirit, and the deep curiosity about the world, and the intense interest in people of all backgrounds, which caused her to pepper everyone she met — from cab drivers to presidents — with a relentless cascade of questions about their lives. She also gave us all her love of language and for good storytelling. I credit her for all my virtues. I’m grateful for her generosity in overlooking my faults.",en,Tweet,6228,292063,26962,35052,5368986,2024-10-10 18:08:59,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZj51OnXgAwikUZ.jpg

'1841146085861155287',"RT @amaryllisfox: The Blob in Washington has been secretly encouraging Israel to start a war with Iran, while publicly calling for them to deescalate.

Vice President Harris, there’s no joy in your Administration lying to the world about helping stoke WWIII.

But then again, Dick Cheney and your 700 other defense industry endorsers were never in it for the vibes.

Look, my friends. You may dislike President Trump’s style of speaking, but he led this country for four years without a single new major war anywhere on Earth. More people died from conflict around the world in the first two years of Biden/Harris than in all four years of Donald J. Trump combined. 

Those who reflexively loathe Trump seem to dismiss this record of peace as a fluke, while simultaneously mocking Trump for holding diplomatic dialogues with our global adversaries. As though the two are somehow unrelated.

But let’s be clear. War is hell. War is a racket. War does not “uplift working people” or help them “get ahead, not just get by.” War drives inflation through the roof, disrupts supply chains around the world, diverts taxpayer money to bombs, sends parents away from their families to fight, and robs civilians of their homes, their limbs, and their lives. War yields multi-decade economic disruption and multi-generational trauma.

We face today the choice between a leader who talks tough while keeping the peace and a leader who talks pretty while making secret plans to plunge the world into war.

Please, for the love of our children, cast your vote based on candidates’ actions, not based on their speechwriters’ words.

'1839504360537039268',"Sheldon Krimsky's 2000 book Hormonal Chaos (published by John Hopkins) is more important today than ever. It lays out the “environmental endocrine hypothesis,” which “asserts that a diverse group of industrial and agricultural chemicals in contact with humans and wildlife have the capacity to mimic or obstruct hormone function…fooling it into accepting new instructions that distort the normal development of the organism…these compounds have been implicated in more than two dozen human and animal disorders, including reproductive and developmental abnormalities, immune dysfunction, cognitive and behavioral pathologies, and cancer.”

Like the great Rachel Carson, Krimsky shared — bravely and meticulously — inconvenient scientific research. I say “bravely” because Krimsky knew the “industrial groups...poised to protect product and sector interests” were none too pleased to see their highly profitable chemicals exposed.

And what’s particularly striking is that on the back of this book, there’s a glowing endorsement from Senator John F. Kerry — “Sheldon Krimsky has written an extremely responsible book and has sounded an important alarm.”

Believe it or not, it was not long ago that concern about toxins in our environment and bodies was primarily a concern of the Left. Leftie writer-activists were the ones who struck fear into the hearts of industry scientists and (borrowing from Teddy Roosevelt) “the malefactors of great wealth.”

No longer. The Democratic party has become the party of the Establishment, of Big Pharma and Big Ag. Of Big Money. And people are catching on.

One chemical Krimsky singles out for criticism is atrazine. I was widely ridiculed in the media for raising concerns that it might affect sexual development in humans. Well, here’s what Krimsky says (p. 204): “More than 220 million pounds of pesticides known or suspected to be endocrine disrupters were applied to 68 different crops in recent years, with atrazine (classified by the EPA as a possible human carcinogen) alone making up 29 percent of the total weight and 22 percent of the total acreage treated.”

Today if you raise concerns like this that interfere with corporate profits and paradigms, you get called a “conspiracy theorist” or “irrational right-wing lunatic.”

'1839286350626914756',"The MSM cheerleading for Ozempic has begun! New op-ed in the NYT “Opinion | Is Obesity a Disease? It’s Complicated in the Age of Ozempic” does make a valid point: that weight-shaming is cruel and that obesity is not a failure of character (we are not, she rightly and humanely states, suffering a “global breakdown in willpower”).

But that doesn’t mean obesity is something that just happens to us. The author never mentions our sickening food system based on a toxic industrial agriculture; in-the-tank government agencies; and the profitable manufacturing of poisonous and addictive processed foods—foods which have taken over our markets, restaurants, and school cafeterias.

Further, she doesn't mention the anxiety and crisis of meaning afflicting many of us—sufferings which tee us up to eat unhealthily. Nor does she mention the effect of excessive screen time, especially among our young people, and the sedentary lifestyles that accompany it.

According to the writer, obesity seems to be a matter of lack—a lack of bariatric surgeries and a lack of Ozempic courtesy of Novo Nordisk, a Danish multinational whose wealth is bigger than Denmark’s entire economy. As this drug becomes more widely available, the journalist seems to suggest, “America’s biggest health problem” will be under control.

Instead of fixing our food system and addressing the obesity crisis at its root, the author focuses on a drug that may palliate the symptom – and gladden the wallets of distant Big Pharma execs.

According to @calleymeans (who is not mentioned in this essay), “almost all of Novo Nordisk revenue is coming from taking advantage of Americans…the biggest target market for any drug in American history.” And this drug, according to Means, possibly causes harmful gastrointestinal, metabolic, and mental side effects (effects not mentioned in this essay). Regardless of possible side effects, some speculate this drug’s burgeoning market will make for a $1 trillion dollar company by 2030.

With a number like that, of course this drug is the answer! It has to be the answer. With a number like that, of course we don't talk about root causes; and about the need for better food and saner farming. Means again: “The second you get someone off the chronic disease treadmill, that’s not a profitable patient.”

Wendell Berry once said the most revolutionary act is a kitchen garden. Not only do you get sunlight, fresh air, bird song, physical work, and tasty healthful food, you weaken your dependence on warped, greedy corporations and the corrupt government agencies that comfort them.  

When I’m working in the next administration, I will address our sick food system—and the corrupt government agencies—to help make our country healthy again.

In the meantime perhaps we should consider replanting the kitchen garden before sending more money to Denmark.",en,Tweet,739,18095,3920,891,638843,2024-09-26 08:50:12,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

“Kennedy is right: All three of the principal health agencies suffer from agency capture. A large portion of the FDA's budget is provided by pharmaceutical companies. NIH is cozy with biomedical and pharmaceutical companies and its scientists are allowed to collect royalties on drugs NIH licenses to pharma. And as the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), I know the agency can be influenced by special interest groups.

But it doesn't stop in the health agencies: the U.S. Department of Agriculture is a captive of industry, too. Created to help the family farmer and to ensure a wholesome food supply, today the agency often favors large corporations over the interests of small farmers and the public's health. To cure our children, we must reevaluate our food choices and the underlying practices of the agricultural sector. We must prioritize wholesome and nutritious food.”

At the same time, we are going to investigate the alarming decline in fertility. We will evaluate research implicating chemicals like glyphosate, BPA, heavy metals, xenoestrogens, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and so on. We will look into nutritional factors too. Why are sperm counts declining year after year? Why are girls reaching puberty so early? Why are so many couples infertile? The American people deserve answers, and we will provide them.

'1830452519358877813',"RT @DavidSacks: IN THE GLOBAL STRUGGLE AGAINST AUTHORITARIANISM, THE WEST’S REAL ENEMY IS ITSELF

American politicians speak constantly about the indispensable role of the United States in leading the free world against authoritarianism. If that is true, why is the White House so silent in the face of new global threats to free speech? 

In January, American citizen Gonzalo Lira died in a Ukrainian prison for posting YouTube videos; the State Department didn’t lift a finger to help. Last week, Telegram founder Pavel Durov was arrested in France for the crime of insufficient content moderation. 

Now Brazil has banned X for resisting the diktats of a tyrannical judge, who salivates over the possibility of jailing @elonmusk. The EU is one step behind, with Eurocrat Thierry Breton pursuing a criminal investigation against Elon for “platforming disinformation,” which Breton defines to include a conversation with Donald Trump. 

In the UK, the government of Keir Starmer imprisons critics of open borders with more zeal than it prosecutes violent crime. In Canada, Justin Trudeau crushed a trucker protest against vaccine mandates by asserting sweeping new powers to freeze bank accounts.  

At no point has the White House expressed concern about this new iron curtain that seems to be descending across the West. Quite the contrary, Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that the Biden-Harris administration repeatedly pressured Meta to censor during Covid. Worse, the FBI primed Facebook to censor true stories about Biden Family corruption by suggesting that Hunter Biden’s laptop was Russian disinformation (even though the FBI knew it was authentic). 

Barring court intervention, TikTok will shut down in the U.S. on January 19, 2025 thanks to a new power authorized by Congress to ban websites and applications that the President determines are subject to the influence of a foreign adversary. X may not be far behind if liberal elites and deep state apparatchiks like Robert Reich and  Alexander Vindman get their wish. They have called for the U.S. to adopt Brazil’s and the EU’s approach and “rein in” Elon Musk. 

Hypocritically, the same voices demanding this crackdown are also the loudest in proclaiming the West to be engaged in a “war on authoritarianism” against countries like Russia and China. But whatever their other sins, Russia and China are in no position to deprive American citizens of their free speech rights; only our own government can do that. 

Similarly, if Western leaders truly wanted to prevent authoritarianism, the easiest place to start would be at home, protecting the civil liberties of their own citizens. Instead they seem obsessed with deflecting the public’s attention onto foreign enemies, as Orwell depicted in the Two Minutes Hate in 1984.  

As this battle over free speech heats up in an election year, where do the candidates stand? Donald Trump has declared his support for free speech whereas Kamala Harris has said nothing and can be expected to continue her administration’s policy of tacit approval of creeping censorship. In just two months, Americans will decide. Do we actually lead the free world in standing up for free speech, or do we accept the authoritarianism we claim to detest so much?",en,Retweet,3723,29606,8123,1826,19037190,2024-09-01 23:47:43,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

I have found to my surprise that many people on the Trump team, including President Trump himself, care  about the same environmental issues I do. Furthermore, these issues can help to unify our nation -- because almost everyone wants clean air, water, food, and soil. Almost everyone values thriving ecosystems and wildlife.

'1828807133267411224',"RT @CaseyMeansMD: Mainstream media playbook: When the culture seems to be turning TOWARDS health, rapidly spin up a BS article (like this one that was published yesterday in TIME) to: 

1. SEED CONFUSION: CONFUSION IS KEY - it makes us doubt our convictions about healthy food. Key here is bringing in “experts” who contradict the science and say it’s sensationalized or impractical to implement. 

2. NORMALIZE: talk about how nearly 80% of calories come from ultraprocessed food so it can’t be that bad, right? IGNORE that 50% of children now have a CHRONIC DISEASE. Use a meaningless anecdote like the author of the article eating 80% processed food and feeling just fine! 🤦🏼‍♀️

3. DISTRACT AND SHUT DOWN DISCOURSE BY BRINGING IN SOCIAL JUSTICE: Focus intensely on social justice issues and questions of food access rather than science (“what would people *possibly* eat if we changed the food system towards real food?!”). Rather than focusing on ANY meaningful solutions that are actually good for the health and wellbeing of all people, focus on how changing the current system would lead to more food insecurity. Don’t mention that taxpayer money is what leads these foods and to be cheap through corrupt subsidies, and we actually have a rigged system against people of lower socioeconomic status that is the ACTUAL social justice issue. Don’t mention that we could rapidly steer the billions of dollars of processed food subsidies towards REAL food access for all Americans if there was a will to do so. 

4. MINIMIZE THE SCIENCE: mention but then QUICKLY minimize the innumerable studies that say ultraprocessed foods impair hormones, metabolic health, and are associated with early death.

5. DEFINITELY DON’T MENTION CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: certainly don’t talk about funding sources and conflicts of interest at NIH, USDA, FDA, academia, OR THE NEWS OUTLET THAT IS PUBLISHING THE ARTICLE.

'1827797721191006378',"RT @glennbeck: YES.  Thank you @RobertKennedyJr .    This is exactly what we mean.  The self examination of our wrongs have made us better, more clear and empathetic.   But the hatred of our country and the hatred that so many try to push is an infection in our family of man.     We have ALL engaged in it at times.   Either to ‘win’ an argument or out of a spirit of anger or divisiveness.   We all must correct our ways, ask for forgiveness and begin again.     It is driving a wedge that we must remove to come together.  The only way we can again come together is to rediscover our reason most of us came here in the first place.   Like it or not, the are the REVOLUTIONARY works of our founding principles.  They are THE SAME principles your father, MLK, and Lincoln espoused.    Yes, we have never met our goals of “all men are created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights.    BUT CAN YOU THINK OF A GRANDER GOAL?   If we could all truly come together.  Equal and not separate.    So many Americans are tired of being told to hate our country, hate our history and hate our neighbor.    We make mistakes, WE LEARN FROM THEM and we come together to march on in hopes of making a MORE perfect nation.     We need each other.   Opposition in all things.   Our diversity allows us to be strong but ONLY if we unify and work as one.   E PLURIBUS UNUM.   From many - ONE.    Not in talent, wealth, failure or success, but in Mind and Spirit.    We come together to be free and be a beacon of hope for all mankind, that yes, here you can pursue our happiness.   Chart our own course, and inspire others.   However, without our rights which are outlined and codified in the Bill of Rights this cannot be done.   There will always be the natural man among us.   Those who thrive on Greed and power.   Their tools are:    lies, hatred, distortion and fear.    Those tools destroy and never build.   The world needs empathy, forgiveness and Truth.   Those are the tools of a Master Builder.   The Truth will set us free.  Let us rebuild and with the lessons of the past in mind, build anew.  This is the real task before each of us.  Are we willing to align ourselves with the principles so many men and women died for?   I for one am ready.   And I begin by recognizing that you, RFK JR, and I do not agree on many things.   But, i know the risk you are taking, the loss of so many friends and family and the sacrifice your family will also be forced to make due to your words and actions today.    I BELIEVE YOU TO BE SINCERE.   You have willingly gone into the lions den for love of Country.   No man risks his entire life of comfort for nothing.  No man risks his life and is willing to be shot and/or die for principles he does not believe are worth dying for.   I believe based on your actions, you belong in your uncles inspirational book.   Many names will be listed from these times.   May we be worthy and willing to stand.   Let us come together where we can, and work all the rest out as friends and Americans.     @RobertfKennedJr  @realDonaldTrump #Election2024",en,Retweet,485,15914,2807,306,1448317,2024-08-25 15:58:30,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/download/ipad"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPad</a>",,,,

'1827707809141518835',"What ""MAGA"" really means

The phrase has troubled liberals who think it is a call for a return to an America before civil rights, gay rights, and women's rights. But I have a more generous interpretation, one that is truer to my experience of Donald Trump as he is today. ""Make America Great Again"" recalls a nation brimming with vitality, with a can-do spirit, with hope and a belief in itself. It was an America that was beginning to confront its darker shadows, could acknowledge the injustice in its past and present, yet at the same time could celebrate its successes. It was a nation of broad prosperity, the world's most vibrant middle class, and a idealistic belief (though not consistently applied) in freedom, justice, and democracy. It was a nation that led the world in innovation, productivity, and technology. And it was the healthiest country in the world. I have talked to many Trump supporters. I have talked with his inner circle. I have talked to the man himself.

The  government’s public health response was not a medical response, but  instead a test of technocratic power:  to see how the population would  respond to totalitarian edicts masked as medical interventions.

The  government also selected the lockdown winners and losers, transferring  nearly 4 trillion dollars of wealth from the middle class & small business to Silicon Valley and big box stores.

There have been NO corrections and NO apologies--because the government wants to be able to do it again.

'1824587284366213559',"More and more in local papers we see photos of young people in the obit section, and more and more the causes of these deaths are unspecified. Often they are unspecified because the cause of death is overdose or suicide. These are the hidden-from-society “deaths of despair.”

Our politics will only be meaningful if it’s faithful to the real and particular challenges of today's Americans. And many Americans, especially young Americans, are feeling cut off and adrift, living “within the context of no context” (a haunting and telling phrase of social thinker George W.S. Trow). Consequently, many young people are depressed or addicted (or both), or seeking refuge in some harmful fundamentalism. Maybe it’s your own child who’s feeling this way. Or your nephew. Or your grandchild. Or your neighbor. Or you.

In my administration we’re going to build healing centers in communities across the nation, places that help empower a generation beset by depression, PTSD, loneliness, addiction, and mental illness, where individual Americans can connect with nature, community, good hard work, and heal.

On these Healing Farms, Americans will eat organic food, unplug from screens, be mentored by peers in recovery, and be of service.

These are not traditional rehab centers. On Healing Farms, struggling Americans will learn new skills such as regenerative farming and ranching, carpentry, furniture-making, plumbing, cooking, electrical work, and other helpful, career-serving skills.

What is happening is this: the greatest ailments of our nation are going undiagnosed by its leaders. The most obvious urgencies are the first to be ignored.

And what are those urgencies?

That our economy and politics have become addicted to war…

That war, which has become an abstraction for so many because we are so distanced from it, threatens to escalate out of control…

That fifty-seven percent of Americans cannot put their hands on a thousand dollars in an emergency…

That hateful division is has become the foundation of electoral politics…

That more than half of Americans are sick in body or mind…

That children are growing up without reliable coordinates, without communities that hold them, attending schools where they spend much of their days on screens…

That we are undergoing a crisis of meaning in our time, a progressive disenchantment and loss of spiritual orientation; and this crisis is rendering some of us apathetic, defeated, and addicted and rendering others fundamentalist about certainties that often involve putting other people down…

That our dwindling spiritual powers are not keeping up with our growing technological ones…

That our government increasingly acts as a wet nurse for a tiny group of powerful elites…

That the party of peace and free speech has become the party of war and mounting government control…

That the other party acts as if caring for our miraculous earth is a sign of shameful weakness…

That elections now require the killing of democracy in order to save it…

That our lives—as these urgencies accumulate—are often both frantically busy and prone to distraction upon distraction upon distraction…

Since that day, the U.S. and the world have gone further and further into a post-industrial casino economy, one of floating exchange rates, financial speculation, and fiat currency for war.

As President, I will pull together a New Bretton Woods conference/process, one that will include nations as equals and not a process that puts the British Commonwealth or American elites at the top. We must partner with nations around the world for peace, which can only be sustained by long-term economic cooperation and real economic growth.

This conference/process can also address concerns over AI, blockchain, and CBDCs.

'1824102759441797600',"Chronic illness is sapping our nation’s vitality. If you include obesity, 60% of Americans have a chronic illness today.

Every American has a family member or friend with one or more chronic illnesses. The Medicare and Medicaid budgets are now 5 times larger than our military budget.

At least 1 in 5 children are diabetic or pre diabetic.

Cancer, Alzheimers, dementia, and autoimmune disorders are on the rise, while heart disease persists as the leading cause of death in Americans.

In the past I’ve pointed to many factors that might be driving this surge in chronic disease: toxic pollution of our soil, air, and water, pesticide residues and “forever chemicals” like PFAS in our food, the childhood vaccine schedule, and electromagnetic pollution. All of these possible causes deserve further study. But here I want to point to one more key factor: the rise of processed foods and the replacement of saturated fat in our diets with highly processed seed oils.

Saturated fat found in animal foods was demonized for decades, the result of flawed science and massive PR campaigns by companies purveying seed oils, food additives, and high fructose corn syrup. Corporations like Procter & Gamble corrupted the American Heart Association, universities, and government agencies.

Today, finally, people are waking up to the fact that we were lied to. If you want to understand this classic example of corporate capture, government malfeasance, and the corruption of science, read the NYT bestseller The Big Fat Surprise, by Nina Teicholz. This exhaustively cited book exposes a health scandal that has contributed enormously to this nation’s chronic disease epidemic. Ironically, Nina was a vegetarian for over 20 years prior to writing this book.

Thanks in part to this book, and the tireless work of alternative health practitioners and researchers over the last 50 years, doctors, dieticians, nutritionists, and the general public are waking up to this issue despite the continued effort by big business and the USDA to keep the lid on it. To this day, the USDA recommends keeping saturated fats to only 10% of caloric intake. Meanwhile people continue to become ill and die because of this lie.

The same lie has been one of the biggest contributing factors to wiping out small family farms and ranches. The dramatic drop in fat consumption over the last 60 years has driven families off the land into the towns and cities. This ripple effect rolled through small feedlots and packing houses with the same damage. Once productive land for our land and communities was sold and covered with subdivisions and septic tanks.

Three generations of the farm and ranch communities have been driven off the land. We are only one generation away from all agriculture being controlled by megacorporations, foreign interests, and institutional investors.

We need to get off of processed foods and get back on real food and get strong again!

'1824053188799889650',"VP Harris’s Democratic Party would be unrecognizable to my father and uncle and I cannot reconcile it with my values.

The Democratic Party of RFK and JFK was the party of civil liberties and free speech. VP Harris‘s is the party of censorship, lockdowns, and medical coercion.

Kennedy Democrats were anti-war. Kamala‘s is riddled with neocon warmongers.

The RFK/JFK dems were allies of Main Street, cops, firefighters, and working people. VP Harris’s is the Party of Big Tech, Big Pharma and Wall Street.

My dad and uncle’s party was the champion of voting rights and fair elections. VP Harris’s is the party of lawfare, disenfranchisement, and the coronation of its candidates by corporate donors and party elites.

I’ve used our nation’s courts to prosecute corporations who hurt Black Americans. VP Harris used our nation’s courts to mercilessly prosecute Black Americans and exploit them for their labor.

My father and uncle prided themselves on their skills at debate and their ability to articulate a coherent vision for our country. VP Harris is scared to debate and can’t survive an unscripted interview. Instead of outlining a vision, she relies on middleschool tactics – memes, forged headlines, infantile slogans (Joy!) and name calling (“Republicans are weird.“)

I’ve spent years battling government corruption and lies. VP Harris spent years gaslighting Americans about the health of our Commander in Chief.

I have no plans to endorse Kamala Harris for President. I do have a plan to defeat her.",en,Tweet,6997,152141,28774,11982,7335083,2024-08-15 07:59:04,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1823441219331961135',"World peace used to be the liberal position, the Democratic position... the Kennedy position. Today instead we  read a sensible pro-peace position in The American Conservative. Here is an excerpt:

“The New National Defense Commission Report Misses the Point. The main threat to American safety comes not from abroad, but from Washington.

""In the Commission’s view, the United States is at great risk. Threats are multiplying around the globe. Only great effort can save the country. Americans must turn over more of their money and sacrifice more of their liberties. They must be scared into compliance…In fact, this is nonsense. For decades the United States has been the most secure great power ever. The U.S. has dominated its continent and entire hemisphere since the mid-19th century. Surrounded by deep waters east and west and weak neighbors north and south, America is largely invulnerable to attack…

""The fact that Washington almost always fights overseas demonstrates that US policy is usually offensive. Most of what America does militarily has little to do with its own security. Wars of choice have been constant, which explains President Joe Biden proudly informing journalist George Stephanopoulos that “I'm running the world.” (Or at least purporting to.)

""[And] Terrorism is a minor national problem…best addressed by doing less overseas, especially the bombing missions, foreign occupations, and miscellaneous interventions that trigger foreign hostility and vengeful attacks.”

The rest of the article rewards study. #Kennedy24

Simultaneously, the EU’s Censorship “Kommisar” Thierry Breton just told Elon Musk he can’t allow EU citizens to witness tonight’s interview with President Trump.

The elites who want to decide what is permissible to read and watch justify their censorship by labeling dissenting opinions as “misinformation,” “hate speech,” “far right,” or “extremist.” During the lockdowns, MI-6 designated me and other health freedom activists as potential “terrorists.” But the label applies more closely to themselves, as they try to scare us into submission again with bird flu hoaxes, debt-fueled financial collapse, and ever more dangerous imperial wars of choice.

This is definitely a wake-up call, America. It’s time to reclaim our government. If not in America, the paragon of freedom, then where?

'1821924669760418175',"During my announcement speech more than a year ago, I said that I have so many skeletons in the closet that if they could vote, I would be king of the world. I knew much would be made of my past. I have been around politics. I know of its hazards. I also knew that my vision and policies would inspire resistance in the establishment.

When you declare yourself foe to widespread corporate-government corruption and declare yourself counter-friction to a runaway war machine (a war machine killing innocents and draining our country’s coffers), you will inspire resistance in the establishment. (Put another way, many powerful people want to make sure the gravy train never stops. And I derail gravy trains.)

When you point out the morbidity of our two-party system -- a system that our first president warned us about, a system that is now largely predicated on hating fellow humans -- you will inspire resistance in the establishment.

When you’ve spent much of your life successfully fighting against our biggest corporations and worst polluters; fighting against mining, timber, hydroelectricity, and oil industries on behalf of the voiceless and the indigenous; fighting against agribusiness barons blithely ravaging the lives of small farmers and small towns, you will inspire resistance in the establishment.

When you remind Americans that censorship and other curtailments of our civil liberties always arrive burnished with a moral and patriotic gloss, you will inspire resistance in the establishment.

When you invoke our crisis of meaning, our deaths of despair, the addiction, and the many children lost to screens, ill health, and ennui, you will inspire resistance in the establishment.

When you are wary of reductive partisan ideology and group-think; and when you refuse the common coin of today’s public discourse -- a glib second-rate cruelty delivered via the screen -- you will inspire resistance in the establishment.

When you assert that to better our country we must work toward a politics that heals this divide and affirms our mutual belonging, you will inspire resistance in the establishment.

As you perhaps know, I am used to such resistance -- used to the bile and malign distortions that accompany speaking out on high-stakes issues. And I know that the establishment’s treatment of me -- while challenging -- makes perfect sense.

The dark and elaborately refined arts of partisan politics deployed to end my campaign (the documented censorship and shadowbanning; the out-in-the-open, anti-democratic, and well-funded attempts to keep me off ballots through expensive, complex, time-consuming legal challenges; the thwarting of debate access; the withholding of secret service protection; the paid staged protests; the sundry campaigns of defamation and scandalmongering) are the logical reactions of a threatened -- and very unwell -- status quo.

And underneath all of this -- underneath much of this election cycle, underneath much of this moment in our nation’s politics -- is a sort of destitution. A destitution of heart. It’s no small wonder so many people have withdrawn from civic life and democracy altogether.

A broken bond needs to be reestablished in our country. We need more soul-searching and less partisan warfare. Our work as Americans, whether we like it or not, transcends all labels and all parties. It seems we will recognize this reality and act accordingly; or be broken into it. History is not made occasionally on great stages by the privileged few but made daily in the depths of each human soul.

Ours is a beautiful nation, still. According to the Internet, our country (and our world) founders in chaos. But in post offices, parks, grocery stores our beauty still heartens and shines. We all see it every day.

It is in the name of that beauty that I work.

It is in the name of that beauty that I run to be your next president.

The true power of America is not its comfort, wealth, or military might, but its ideals of liberty, democracy, and
generosity.

This campaign is about honoring and restoring those ideals -- regardless of the defamation, evasion, and trickery. We knew those were coming.

Bread has gone up by a factor of ten since then, but the farmer has gotten none of that money. Something is seriously wrong with a system where those who produce our food can barely afford to buy it themselves without going deeper and deeper into debt every year.

A bushel of wheat can make at least 50 loaves of bread, which means the cost of the wheat in a loaf of bread is only about ten cents. In other words, we could pay our farmers double, and the price of bread would barely rise.

'1820973377340760224',"Plato famously tells us of prisoners chained in a cave, unable to move their bodies, looking at a blank wall. Behind them are puppeteers holding up puppets and a fire. The prisoners can’t see the puppeteers, or the puppets, or the fire. What the prisoners see are conjured shadows on the wall. And the prisoners mistake those shadows for life, for reality, for truth.

This old story speaks to us now.

It describes the way the media projects a distorted shadow of reality onto our televisions and computer screens. It describes the way politicians from the two parties distort fellow Americans into black-and-white abstractions and hate-objects.

America, we need to escape this captivity. We need to leave the cave. We can no longer mistake shadows for the truth.

'1820958864210325943',"RT @NicoleShanahan: Expert consensus is highly valued in policy-making. Consensus is typically achieved through strong technical arguments across a diversity of qualified experts. Historically, multiple opinions were consulted and dissenting opinions were respected in the overall discourse. This ongoing debate enhances public trust in institutions. 

However, censorship culture now enables consensus through character assassination of dissenters. This may expedite policy-making but it undermines institutional credibility. Restoring trust requires reintegrating expert critics into institutional life. 

Tomorrow, I'll be hosting a live discussion featuring several prominent dissenting voices who have faced maligning, disparagement, censorship, and cancellation by the very institutions they served. Their voices will be heard. 🇺🇸

'1820532598705201564',"Powerful insight from @DA_Stockman about what is holding back crypto. He is commenting on my recent statement:

""I am going to support making direct ownership of Bitcoin tax-free. The conversion of Bitcoin back into dollars will be a non-reportable transaction to the IRS and not subject to capital gain.""

David says:

The significance of the bolded phrases cannot be overstated. The problem with Bitcoin and all other crypto-currencies today is that they are effectively incarcerated on a monetary reservation surrounded by Federal cops and tax collectors. Accordingly, they have developed no meaningful “use” case or attributes of “moneyness” because Bitcoin is quasi-inconvertible: the risks of bringing wealth stored in Bitcoins back across the tax and regulatory ramps to the banking system world of dollars are just too severe.
As a result, the crypto-world’s state-erected monetary reservation resembles a gambling casino in the otherwise uninhabitable Nevada desert. Capital goes there to wager and punt, but not to operate, invest and settle. And that, in turn, blocks crypto’s capacity to evolve into a usable and stable non-state money that can function both as a store of value and a transaction medium for everyday commerce.
... The violent trading range of Bitcoin just in the last few years... is not evidence of a new money aborning. It tracks the frolicking of Wall Street punters enabled by cheap carry-trade funding and emboldened by the Fed Put under risk asset markets generally.
That is to say, the Fed’s unremitting corruption of the dollar and the Wall Street trading venues has generated an endless search for new wagering opportunities. Not surprisingly, therefore, Wall Street quickly turned crypto-currencies into yet another “asset class”, which is now being aggressively traded by chart-monkeys and algorithms based on factors that are purely intrinsic to the vibrations of the electronic trading pits.
Accordingly, the market cap of Bitcoin currently stands at $1.347 trillion and the 2,400 outstanding cryptos as a group are valued at $2.45 trillion. Yet all of this “value” has been generated without even the bother of price discovery on the appropriate cap rates for non-existent earnings, dividends, other returns on capital, or even at least some evidence of value-added in main street commerce.
That is to say, hemmed in by Federal cops and tax collectors and dominated by Wall Street speculators, these virtuous candidates for badly needed non-state money have metastasized into gambling chips, mainly owned by the 1% and their wanna be imitators among the homegamers.
Meanwhile, with cryptos cordoned off in the gambling pits, this variation of Gresham’s Law works its will. By driving out good money from daily commerce, the central bankers ensure that depreciating dollars remain the spending medium of the main street economy.",en,Tweet,232,2449,430,150,278689,2024-08-05 14:49:30,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1819010409803747378',"Lots of truth bombs from the mouth of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Here are some excerpts, organized by topic. Full speech link: https://t.co/uhZYl4D9Kv

The war is our red pill:

Dear  Friends, the war is our red pill. Think of the “Matrix” films. The hero  is faced with a choice. He has two pills to choose from: if he swallows  the blue pill, he can stay in the world of surface appearances; if he  swallows the red pill, he can look into and descend into reality. The  war is our red pill: it is what we have been given, it is what we must  swallow. And now, armed with new experiences, we must talk about  reality.

On Democrats/US pressure:

All  that Europe is doing today is unconditionally following the foreign  policy line of the US Democrats – even at the cost of its own  self-destruction.

We  let the blowing up of the Nord Stream pipeline go unchallenged; Germany  itself let an act of terrorism against its own property – which was  obviously carried out under US direction – go unchallenged, and we are  not saying a word about it, we are not investigating it, we do not want  to clarify it, we do not want to raise it in a legal context.

When,  to the astonishment of Hungarians, one sees the German chancellor  announcing that he is only sending helmets to the war, and then a week  later he announces that he is in fact sending weapons, do not think that  the man has lost his mind. Then when the same German chancellor  announces that there may be sanctions, but that they must not cover  energy, and then two weeks later he himself is at the head of the  sanctions policy, do not think that the man has lost his mind. On the  contrary, he is very much in his right mind. He is well aware that the  Americans and the liberal opinion-forming vehicles they influence –  universities, think tanks, research institutes, the media – are using  public opinion to punish Franco–German policy that is not in line with  American interests.

Reality today:

We  [Hungary] have received a démarche from Brussels: they have condemned  the Hungarian peace mission efforts. I have tried – without success – to  explain that there is such a thing as Christian duty. This means that  if you see something bad in the world – especially something very bad –  and you receive some instrument for its correction, then it is a  Christian duty to take action, without undue contemplation or  reflection. The Hungarian peace mission is about this duty… The peace  mission is not just about seeking peace, but is also about urging Europe  to finally pursue an independent policy.

We  [Hungary] will not allow ourselves to be locked into only one of either  of the two emerging hemispheres in the world economy… We have to be in  both, in the Western and in the Eastern… We will not get involved in the  war against the East. We will not join in the formation of a  technological bloc opposing the East, and we will not join in the  formation of a trade bloc opposing the East. We are gathering friends  and partners, not economic or ideological enemies. We are not taking the  intellectually much easier path of latching on to someone, but we are  going our own way. This is difficult – but then there is a reason that  politics is described as an art.

Central  Europeans like us are immediately reminded of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,  who taught that with the advent of communism the state will die, but  that the state will die while first constantly strengthening. Brussels  is also creating peace by constantly supporting war. Just as we did not  understand Lenin’s thesis in our university lectures on the history of  the labour movement, I do not understand the Brusseleers in European  Council meetings. Perhaps Orwell was right after all when he wrote that  in “Newspeak” peace is war and war is peace.

Red  pill number six: the spiritual solitude of the West. Up until now the  West has thought and behaved as if it sees itself as a reference point, a  kind of benchmark for the world… Once again the West has declared its  expectation, its instruction, for the world to take a moral stand  against Russia and for the West. In contrast, the reality has become  that, step-by-step, everyone is siding with Russia. That China and North  Korea are doing so is perhaps no surprise. That Iran is doing the same –  given Iran’s history and its relationship with Russia – is somewhat  surprising. But the fact that India, which the Western world calls the  most populous democracy, is also on the side of the Russians is  astonishing. That Turkey refuses to accept the West’s morally based  demands, even though it is a NATO member, is truly surprising. And the  fact that the Muslim world sees Russia not as an enemy but as a partner  is completely unexpected.

Echoing Ray Dalio:

In  the past, change was Western: the Habsburgs rose and then fell; Spain  was up, and it became the centre of power; it fell, and the English  rose; the First World War finished off the monarchies; the British were  replaced by the Americans as world leaders; then the Russo–American Cold  War was won by the Americans. But all these developments remained  within our Western logic. This is not the case now, however, and this is  what we must face up to; because the Western world is not challenged  from within the Western world, and so the logic of change has been  disrupted. What I am talking about, and what we are facing, is actually a  global system change.

Conclusion:

While  Ukraine is asking us for more loans, negotiations are underway to write  off the loans it has previously taken out. Today the creditors and  Ukraine are arguing over whether it should repay 20 per cent or 60 per  cent of the debt it has taken on. This is the reality of the situation.  In other words, the European Union has to pay the price of this military  adventure.

The  war has helped us to understand the real state of power in the world.  It is a sign that in its mission the West has shot itself in the foot,  and is therefore accelerating the changes that are transforming the  world.",en,Tweet,787,4506,1201,234,308943,2024-08-01 10:00:51,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,https://miniszterelnok.hu/en/speech-by-prime-minister-viktor-orban-at-the-33rd-balvanyos-summer-free-university-and-student-camp/,,

Many kids today feel uneasy engaging directly with the world. Virtual reality is becoming more compelling to them than material reality. Like so many of us today, children are without a proper orientation. For many the center of gravity in their lives is not family and community but the glow of the gadget. This is concerning. 
 
And that’s not mentioning the related rise in anguish among our young people, the avalanche of disturbing statistics. As social thinker Jonathan Haidt says, we’re over-protecting our kids in the real world and under-protecting them in the digital world. And their souls are paying a price. Our Surgeon General calls our youth's mental health crisis ""the defining public health issue of our time."" 
 
Meanwhile, many of the creators of these gadgets in Silicon Valley make sure their children use these gadgets sparingly. In an interview with The New York Times just before he died Steve Jobs said he banned his kids from using the newly released iPad.“We don’t allow the iPad in the home. We think it’s too dangerous for them in effect.” If contemplated carefully that single remark could alter the behavior of the world.

'1817769913475338641',"The Nuremberg Code was established after World War 2 as the ethical and  legal standard for conducting medical research in human subjects,  worldwide.

But in the US  it has been whittled down by the FDA and Congress to ease the legal  constraints and financial costs for pharmaceutical companies conducting  research in humans.

In  January, the FDA issued a Final Rule that allows Institutional Review  Boards hired by Pharma to determine that certain research constitutes  only “minimal risk” (a definition with lots of wiggle room) and  therefore does not require the informed consent of the subjects!

https://t.co/wfPdrwWrti

'1817728093940859101',"“We finally beat Big Pharma,” says the Biden Harris Administration

If that is true, then why are kids still mandated over 76 vaccines?
Why are vaccine makers still indemnified when they injure or kill someone?
Why are there no thorough long-term studies showing all-cause mortality and that the vaccines are truly safe and effective?

Why did Pfizer make over $100 Billion in 2022 from the pandemic that you mandated?

How much did your mandates give to all the vaccine companies?

You may have capped a few prices, that’s great, but have you ended the corruption in pharma?

I don't think so.

But I will end it.

'1817323417466466795',"Here’s what you should know about me:
✅I’m an environmental lawyer and advocate, not a career politician. 
✅I’ve spent the last 40 years fighting large corporate polluters and corrupt government agencies, and trying to protect America’s wild places and the quality of your food, the water you drink, and the air that you breathe.
✅I’m not bought and I’m not buyable by corporate interests or by the big lobbyists (which makes me the most feared and hated presidential candidate among the elites).

Here’s what I believe about you:
✅You work hard, pay your taxes, and play by the rules—and you expect the same from your government, who you want to believe is working for YOU.
✅You and your generation have been crippled with debt by the folks in power. You feel lied to by the government and mainstream media.
✅You feel disenfranchised, disillusioned, and disenchanted with the whole political process. 

Enough is enough. That’s why I’m running for president. And I look forward to earning your vote. Put me under a microscope. Hold me to account. I’m applying for a job, and you’re the recruiters. I can’t wait to see you on the campaign trail.

“He’s right to say BlackRock, which is a financial firm that makes money off of pooling a bunch of money and investing it in America’s biggest corporations, they have a vested interest in corporations doing well, that means wages being low and prices being high.

It also means things like potentially prolonging the war in Ukraine … because that’s something that they will profit off of.

And regular families that can’t make ends meet, a big part of this is rent increases. BlackRock has a ton of real estate investments.

They’ve taken on debt in order to make ends meet, and now part of paying their regular bills is paying off interest.

[RFK] is right to point that out as well.

We just don’t see establishment Democrats or Donald Trump talk about this.

Saying a Trump presidency this time around can’t be again hiring people from this ruling class, this vampire class.”

'1815926299195535414',"Government electronic records cannot be trusted. And blockchain technology can remedy that.

Democracy depends on government transparency, and transparency requires the faithful preservation of government records. If those records can be tampered with, altered, or destroyed, then government cannot be accountable to the people. FOIA requests mean nothing if the information obtained is fraudulent.

A couple months ago, emails came to light in which Dr. David Morens, formerly a senior advisor to Dr. Fauci, described seeking help from ""our IT folks"" and ""our FOIA lady how to make emails disappear."" We will probably never know what was in those “disappeared” documents.

A similar issue is arising in the investigations into the Secret Service around the July 13 assassination attempt on President Trump. @SenRonJohnson has informed the FBI, DOJ, & DHS that they must preserve and present to the Senate all information relating to the planning & execution of security measures at the July 13 rally in Pennsylvania. But for all we know, this information is already being destroyed, hidden, or altered by these agencies.

Digital records are easy to alter without a trace. In the Orwellian extreme, those with access to records can rewrite history. However, blockchain technology can make records virtually unalterable through a decentralized database, whose nodes are distributed across multiple agencies and multiple branches of government. When I become President I will direct the National Archives and Records Administration to begin moving government records onto a blockchain, and develop protocols to make all government records transparent and all actions accountable. Not only will corrupt officials be unable to hide from FIOA requests — we won’t even need FOIA requests.

I call on the Democratic Party to return to its traditional commitment to democracy and exemplify it with an open process.

'1812626325519446427',"Beautiful words from Melania Trump. Let all Americans remember that their opponents are full, precious human beings. 

""A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion—his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration. The core facets of my husband's life—his human side—were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.

Let us not forget that differing opinions, policy, and political games are inferior to love. Our personal, structural, and life commitment - until death - is at serious risk. Political concepts are simple when compared to us, human beings…

This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence. We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends. We can realize this world again. Each of us must demand to get it back. We must insist that respect fills the cornerstone of our relationships, again.""",en,Tweet,2251,129323,12632,2087,4565990,2024-07-14 19:12:47,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
'1812571057800532146',"My deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief who was tragically killed at yesterday's Trump rally in Pennsylvania. This morning, his daughter Allyson shared a deeply moving tribute to her father on Facebook, describing how he died shielding Allyson and her mother from the bullets that came at them. ""We lost a selfless, loving, husband, father, brother, uncle, son, and friend...the best dad a girl could ever ask for,” she wrote. ""He died a real-life superhero.""

The impact of the rampant vitriol and divisiveness in today's political and media landscape – and, increasingly, political violence – isn’t isolated to presidential candidates or political parties. As this tragedy shows, it also takes an unimaginable toll on our country's citizens: American families with hearts and hopes, like the Comperatore family.

America has fallen off the precipice, but we can still climb back up. As a nation, we can overcome this. But we need to learn how to better understand and empathize with one another, converse with respectful dialogue, and regard differing viewpoints with dignity and respect.

A GoFundMe has been set up to support Allyson and her family: https://t.co/v9dzrnmLBA

While the moral argument for reparations is compelling, persistent opposition in Congress makes their implementation challenging. However, I am committed to enacting effective and achievable solutions to uplift Black Americans – and will do so immediately as President.

'1810681002588557703',"This week the world beholds the sorry spectacle of a western imperium careening towards catastrophe as NATO descends on Washington. The DC press corps is rightfully concerned about the direction of travel: “Storm clouds gather as NATO leaders converge on Washington…” And well they should be, because NATO’s top priority right now is waging war, not maintaining peace. NATO has agreed with Zelensky to set up a command, under a three star general, with 700 soldiers in Germany and Eastern Europe. The headlines of press releases reveal a consistent pattern of dangerous escalation, as top NATO enforcers pressure individual countries to pay up and fight, exulting that: “for the first time, we have a NATO document agreed at the heads-of-state government level.”

The pattern is exactly the same as in Vietnam, which started with the CIA running paramilitary operations in the conflict area. As the NY Times revealed months ago, the CIA has been operating twelve bases in Ukraine for ten years. According to Ukrainian General Serhii Dvoretskiy, they are financed “One hundred and ten percent,” by the CIA. 

Next in Vietnam came the “military advisers”. In Ukraine, these have taken the form of mercenaries and “retired” US military personnel. They are there on the ground,  supervising the training of Ukrainian draftees.

While the presence of official US and NATO military personnel in Ukraine is limited, the next step looms before us: 500,000 troops have been placed on “high readiness.”

Here’s what NATO leaders have already agreed to:

“First, NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine…Second, a financial pledge [of at least $40B/year]... Allies are [also] set to endorse a pledge that will strengthen transatlantic defense industrial cooperation, to boost production.”

A NATO Summit in Washington will be an utterly different affair when I am President. Stop the carnage. End the warfare state. No more dollars for death. #Kennedy24",en,Tweet,314,6134,1381,448,476560,2024-07-09 10:22:46,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1808175579541430319',"The Chevron decision cuts both ways. 
The original ruling allowed agencies to function effectively, which they cannot if every interpretative gray area in the law requires a court decision.

If the agency is working in the public interest, we definitely want it to exercise broad interpretive leeway. For instance, almost every important environmental decision in federal court over the past 40 years is based upon Chevron. Without it, the EPA (not an entirely captured agency) is virtually powerless.

But when corporate interests have captured a federal agency, then the same interpretive leeway gives the agency even more power to serve their corporate masters at the expense of the public interest. Thus we have the FDA sending armed police to shut down Amish farmers and grocery stores for selling raw milk, while they allow into our food supply hundreds of harmful but profitable chemical additives that are banned in other countries.

The Chevron controversy is therefore a false dilemma with no solution. The real issue is corporate capture. If federal agencies served the public interest, then no one would want to hamstring them.",en,Tweet,685,7507,1084,2708,1492249,2024-07-02 12:27:07,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1807489812896915767',"RT @NicoleShanahan: Moms have a super power. They have an intuition. Trusting and giving voice to that is what our campaign believes in. 

We believe in free speech, in open communication; because we know parents when given that choice will do what’s best for their family. 

The other parties take money from corporate interests. They censor free speech. They use these techniques to coerce you into a way of being that aligns with their interests. 

The latest sign of this is how the Dems will pick whoever they want to run. Instead of having to run a free and fair primary.",en,Retweet,26,1674,262,68,219725,2024-06-30 15:02:07,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1807423433069744232',"While I object to calling human beings “illegals,” something is seriously wrong here. I would go to great lengths to help others, and I respect that impulse enormously. But I see homeless Americans, many of them veterans, in every city I visit in this country, sleeping under freeways in ragged tents, defecating in buckets and begging for food. Obviously that is a complex problem and there is often addiction and mental illness involved, but this young undocumented woman is staying in the posh Roosevelt Hotel for free for two months in NYC with food and expenses paid. And at the end of those months, she simply reapplies for a new hotel room. I’m not blaming her – quite likely, her backstory is filled with hardship and courage. But we should not be housing migrants in five-star hotels while our country is in the midst of a desperate homeless problem and housing affordability crisis.

'1806531586843885719',"RT @EndTribalism: Take 3 minutes and watch this.

RFK Jr’s closing remarks from the Trump/Biden debate:

“There was a poll taken that asked young people under 35 in this country, are you proud of the United States? 85% said yes. The same poll taken five months ago, 18% said yes. So somehow, during the administration of these two presidents, an entire generation of Americans has lost pride in our country, hope in their own futures. 

They feel that way because they see what's happening. They can't get into a home, first generation in history in America, that is gonna live worse lives than their parents.

They see the vitriol that you saw here, the division, the polarization that makes them disgusted with politics. They're seeing the corrupt merger of state and corporate power that has transformed our agencies from the CIA, the health agencies, the environmental agencies into sock puppets. The industries they're supposed to regulate.

They're seeing the destruction of our soils, the destruction of our air and water. They're watching this happen and the politicians do nothing about it except for hate on each other. If you want more of the same, you should vote for President Biden, President Trump, you know what's gonna happen.

They're gonna give you four more years of the same stuff. If you want things to completely change, you're gonna support me because I'm gonna change everything.

This is a moral fight. This is a moral battle for the soul of our nation. To restore our moral authority around the world by projecting economic power broad rather than spending $8 trillion on regime change wars that have left every nation we've touched worse off than we found it, and restoring our moral authority here at home. 

The first day in office, you heard what they're gonna do. 

Here's what I'm gonna do. Day one in office, I'm gonna issue an executive order saying any federal official who tells a lie to the American public will lose his job. I'm gonna stop the surveillance state.

I'm gonna stop the propagandizing by our agencies of the American public. I'm gonna unravel the war machine. I'm gonna unravel the corrupt merger of state and corporate power.

I know how to do it. I've been litigating against these agencies for years, and I'm uniquely suited to do this.

I can tell you, I'm gonna do these things when I get in there. I'm gonna make sure that our Constitution is protected, and AI is deployed to make government more transparent rather than by government to enslave the rest of us.

I'm gonna bring AI home and blockchain home because we need these new industries to grow our way out of the debt crisis. This is something that these two aren't even talking about, but if you want everything to change, you'll support me.

If you wanna vote out of fear, you need to support one of those guys. If you wanna vote out of hope, out of inspiration, out of pride in your country, out of restoring the moral backbone of our people and our nation, you should vote for me. Thank you very much.”",en,Retweet,3120,22098,5179,620,2947798,2024-06-27 23:34:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1806531429330767873/vid/avc1/888x512/iAFobP7bL8LaX6MX.mp4?tag=16
