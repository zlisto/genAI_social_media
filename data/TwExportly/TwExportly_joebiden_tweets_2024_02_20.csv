1732491860751634904,"Who is Jesus Christ?

Corporate churches and their pastors/priests rarely get into the meat of The Word. They present Christ as simply the Son of God when there is alot more to The Messiah that's either not focused upon or not known. This leaves the people without a deeper understanding. So let's dig and see what Christ says about Himself - Who He is, Where He has been, and When He has been.

First, let's establish another of Christ's Name that's rarely referenced.

Rev 19:13  And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.

Christ has named Himself ""The Word of God"". So when you say ""Let's study The Word"" you're actually saying ""Let's study Jesus Christ."" Having established His name is The Word, let's check out who Jesus Christ said He was and is.
Joh 14:8  Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 
Joh 14:9  Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? 

Christ clarifies to Philip that He is God The Father of the Old Testament. If you have seen The Father you have seen The son. In Hebrews it is reiterated.

Heb 1:3  Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; 

Christ is the exact image of God The Father. Why? Because they are the same God.

Having established who Christ is, let's let The Word (Jesus Christ) tell us where and when Christ has been. In John we have the following verses. Remember, The Word of God = Jesus Christ.

Joh 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
Joh 1:2  The same was in the beginning with God. 
Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. 

So we see that it was Jesus Christ that was there since the beginnning of the creation. Let's play a little Word game, pun intended, to drive the point home. 

Joh 1:1  In the beginning was Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ was with God, and Jesus Christ was God. 
Joh 1:2  Jesus Christ was in the beginning with God. 
Joh 1:3  All things were made by Jesus Christ; and without Jesus Christ was not any thing made that was made. 

Clarity. The Word clarifies Himself if one digs a little. Hebrews says the same thing.

Heb 11:3  Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God (Jesus Christ), so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. 

Now let's go the very beginning of The Bible, the book of Genesis with the new understanding of what The Word was telling us about Jesus Christ.

Gen 1:1  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

Let's apply the same Word game as above.

Gen 1:1  In the beginning Jesus Christ created the heaven and the earth.

Christ clarified who He was and is to us. 

We established the Who: The Word = Christ = God The Father.

The Where: With God The Father.

The When: In the beginning.

That's why Jesus Christ is referred to in the book of Revelation as The Alpha and The Omega, the beginning and the end. For He has always been, and will always be. He is the Circle that connects the beginning and the end. He is Eternity. He is The One True God.

In Christ's Name
