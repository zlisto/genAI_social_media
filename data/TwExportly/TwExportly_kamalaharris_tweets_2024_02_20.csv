Today, it was another campus of students terrorized while being told to RUN-HIDE-FIGHT as an active shooter opened fire at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas – only miles from the site of the deadliest mass shooting in American history.

And yesterday, it was two more communities in Texas experiencing a string of senseless violence as a gunman killed six people and injured three more, including two police officers, in Austin and San Antonio – only miles from the sites of devastating mass shootings in Uvalde and Sutherland Springs.

Doug and I are mourning those who were killed and praying for the victims and their families. We are grieving for the students and so many more whose lives are forever changed. And we are thinking of the members of law enforcement who put themselves in harm’s way to bring these shooting sprees to an end.
