'1883240718170239464',"RT @klarnaseb: NOTE: Using OpenAi Operator at your bank in EU is illegal by law! Web access for assistants was banned years ago as part of “Open banking”

Here is the story of why:

15 years ago I stumbled into Sofort in Germany. A company with the idea to build a digital assistant that would interact with your banks poor UI, so you as a user could avoid it. Just like operator. Back then it was script based, not AI but it worked. 

I was so impressed Klarna bought the company. It has since then processed billions of dollars. 

But of course banks got scared! What happens if people use the digital assistant only, instead of their bank. And what if the assistant says, stop paying those fees to your bank and let me help you switch?

So German banks sued. They claimed privacy concerns. It went to Brussels and a long lobbying and legal fight pursued. This was the beginning of what we today call open banking!

I and others spent years fighting over consumers right to use digital assistants, when accessing their banks. We knew this was critical to create real competition, in an industry that has been plagued by excess profits for years. 

At first Jonathan Hill from UK was responsible and very supportive. But then he left and a German guy came onboard. He was 100% aligned with incumbent banks and we thought the case was lost. However he did a mistake and let some Russian oligarchs take him for a ride on their private jet. And so he was out. 

Finally @VDombrovskis stepped in. He was smart and supportive but pressure from banks was intense. There was rumors that they were funding privacy groups in Germany, to have them use privacy concerns to kill Open Banking. What if the digital assistant accessed some of your private data?

We were about to loose the vote, when the competitive authorities of EU started getting interested. They suspected the banks were lobbying and pursuing this matter for profit reasons to reduce competition(really…). A few weeks before the vote in parliament they raided the offices of some Dutch and Polish banks. Everyone got super nervous and the Open Banking regulation was passed!

Almost…

A small technical detail was left to EBA (European banking authorities). Should your digital assistant use an API for access to your bank account or the standard web UI you use yourself for accessing your bank?

We pushed as hard as we could. We highlighted and said, if your assistant is mandated to use the API that your bank supplies. What if the API don’t support all the same features. Or the API is broken?

Don’t worry said regulators. You can complain with authorities 😂 

We said at least let the digital assistant, as fall back, use the web UI. Then banks cant cheat, as they will know we can always use the same UI as their human customers. It’s called self regulation. But EBA ignored us. 

Today web UI access for digital assistants as ChatGPT Operator is illegal by law. 

And surprise, surprise the open banking API of European banks, continue to be broken, lack functionality and banks add as much friction as they can. We report and see thousands of issues with these APIs every year. 

And people ask me why open banking has not become a larger success…

'1881830103858172059',"RT @OpenAI: Announcing The Stargate Project

The Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. We will begin deploying $100 billion immediately. This infrastructure will secure American leadership in AI, create hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and generate massive economic benefit for the entire world. This project will not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.

The initial equity funders in Stargate are SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX. SoftBank and OpenAI are the lead partners for Stargate, with SoftBank having financial responsibility and OpenAI having operational responsibility. Masayoshi Son will be the chairman.

Arm, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Oracle, and OpenAI are the key initial technology partners. The buildout is currently underway, starting in Texas, and we are evaluating potential sites across the country for more campuses as we finalize definitive agreements.

As part of Stargate, Oracle, NVIDIA, and OpenAI will closely collaborate to build and operate this computing system. This builds on a deep collaboration between OpenAI and NVIDIA going back to 2016 and a newer partnership between OpenAI and Oracle.

This also builds on the existing OpenAI partnership with Microsoft. OpenAI will continue to increase its consumption of Azure as OpenAI continues its work with Microsoft with this additional compute to train leading models and deliver great products and services.

All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI—and in particular AGI—for the benefit of all of humanity.

in case there is any doubt about the goal here, here is something annie's lawyer wrote to my lawyer:

""Significantly, given our client’s tort claims involve sexual assault and sexual battery, we are allowed to seek punitive damages in this case under Missouri law. This means we will be allowed to seek discovery on Sam Altman’s net worth and present Sam Altman’s net worth to the jury for consideration on a punitive damages award. It is not often where we have a case involving childhood sexual abuse spanning many years of rape and incest where the individual Defendant has the ability to pay a nine-figure punitive damages verdict. That is a very real possibility here. Most sexual abuse cases take two years on average to litigate. I would expect based on my research that Mr. Altman’s net worth may exceed $1 Billion by the time we get to trial, if it hasn’t already.""",en,Reply,227,2294,28,205,550846,2025-01-08 00:42:30,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
